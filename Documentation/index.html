          <h2> Getting Started</h2>
          <h3 id="thanks"> Thanks for purchasing Snapify!</h3>

          <p> Here, we've put together a comprehensive documentation to help you out using snapify - and making your life easier.</p>

          <h3 id="whatwho"> What is Snapify and Who is it for?</h3>
          <p>Snapify is a WordPress plugin that lets you backup and move your entire WordPress site to another server easily.</p>
          <p>This is done by packing your whole site (themes, plugins, settings, content, etc...) into a setup wizard that
            you can just throw onto your new server and install.</p>
          <p>On your new server you just access the PHP installer and it will automatically restore all of your website - you
            won't even need to enter the new URL!
          </p>
          <p>Snapify is built from 2 separate parts, one is the WordPress plugin and one which is the installer.</p>          
          <h3 id="installer"> The Installer File</h3>
          <p>The installer is a script which is supposed to restore your WordPress site after backupping with the Snapify plugin.</p>
          <p>The installer is not part of the Snapify WordPress plugin - it is only used as a file for the download of the backup so you could restore that backup.</p>
          <p> Which means it does not follow the WordPress standards - 
            it has to include jquery by itself because when it is used WordPress is not installed yet. 
          </p>
          <p>This file is not part of the WordPress plugin, but is used only after backupping, to restore your site.
          </p>

          </ul>

          <h3 id="install"> Install</h3>
          <p>To install Snapify, open the WordPress admin panel <a href="https://codex.WordPress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation">upload, install and activate</a> 
          the Snapify Plugin.</p> 
          <p>Then you can click on: <strong>Tools</strong>-><strong>Snapify</strong> there press <strong>Backup</strong>. </p>
          <p>Then you will get a download
            prompt of a zip file. <u>This is your whole site's' backup</u>.</p>
          <p> You will have to use the installer download link to download the installer, without that file you can't install the backup on your new server </p>
          <p>To move your site on a new location upload the backup zip file and extract it on your new server. Make sure that
            the files have write and execute permissions.</p>
          <p>Then browse to the <strong>snapify.php</strong> file and press Install. You need to enter your new MySQL settings (DB name, user,
            pass and host), after that it will install and direct you to your site - and you're all done!</p>

          <h2 id="common_qnp" style="background-color: #b2ffb2;border-radius: 10px;padding: 15px;"> Common Questions and Problems </h2>
          <i>Make sure you are using the latest version of snapify before contacting support.</i>
          <h3 id="multisite_support"> Does it support multisite? </h3>
          <p>Not currently, but please tell us if this is a feature you need. </p>
          <h3 id="debug_not_found"> Debug file not found! </h3>
          <p>Did you antecedently delete the debug log file? if not, Please <a href="#extra_support">contact us</a> with your debug log. </p>
          <h3 id="error_mysql"> Error connecting to MySQL server: ... </h3>
          <p>Please check that your credentials are correct and that the supplied settings in the installer for MySQL are correct.</p>
          <h3 id="bad_characterset"> Bad character set detected... </h3>
          <p>This may be resolved if you use the "Force-UTF8" checkbox in the Snapify plugin (when backupping) and try again.</p>
          <h3 id="database_already_created"> Database name supplied is already created... </h3>
          <p>This means that MySQL already has a database with the name you supplied. You can override it by checking the "Override Database" checkbox when installing. Or, delete the database manually.</p>
          <h3 id="cant_create_db"> Could not create database... </h3>
          <p>This means that Snapify can't create a new database either because you didn't use the root MySQL user or because you didn't grant the user the ability to create a new database. If you can't grant that permission, then you can create the database yourself and click the "Override Database" checkbox when installing.</p>
          <h3 id="error_selecting_database"> Error selecting MySQL database: ... </h3>
          <p>Double check that your user has the required permissions for the supplied database name.</p>
          <h3 id="halting_import"> Halting import, error performing query ... </h3>
          <p>Make sure that you didn't edit the snapify.sql file, because this means that it has SQL errors, please <a href="#extra_support">contact us</a> with your debug log, so we could help you out.</p>
          <h3 id="error_performing_query"> Error performing query ... </h3>
          <p>Please <a href="#extra_support">contact us</a> with your debug log.</p>
          <h3 id="current_directory_not_writable"> The current directory isn't writable ... </h3>
          <p>Check that the Snapify direcotry has write permissions for the web user (usually www-data). If not, you can run: [chmod -R 777 ./] in the directory, keep in mind that this isn't the best security practice, so change it after snapify finishes. </p>
          <h3 id="wordfence"> Failed opening required ... wordfence-waf.php ... </h3>
          <p> This means that your Wordfence WAF is blocking the restore of your website because it uses bad paths. Please disable it and try to backup again without it.</p>
          <h3 id="backup_methods"> What are all these "Backup Methods"? </h3>
          <p><u>Compressed Download</u> - will compress your files on the server and then initiate a backup process</p><p><u>Stream Download</u> - will compress your files on the fly and start the download imminently (good for large sites, that don't have space)</p><p><u>Database Backup Only</u> - will not include all of your files, but will include your database contents. Then you can add your files yourself (via ftp/scp download) and add them to the snapify.zip, used mainly in debug situations.</p>
